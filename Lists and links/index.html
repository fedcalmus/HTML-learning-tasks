<h1>Some Interesting Facts about Film History :)</h1>
<h4>Ordered List +Linking to a Specific
    Part of the <a href="#link">Same Page</a></h4>
<ol>
    <li>Originally, the term “movies” did not mean films, but the people who made them.</li>
    <li>The first moving picture cameras were invented towards the late 1800s, and movies were boring.
        They were a single scene, about a minute long, and they were silent.</li>
    <li> To make up for the lack of sound in the film, a band would play live music while the movie ran.</li>
    <li>13 FRAMES PER SECOND - The minimum speed that the human brain needs in order to process consecutive images as movement.
        Anything less than that, the human brain will process each frame as a separate picture.
        16 is pretty close to 13, which is why old movies look so choppy and unnatural.</li>
