<p>Avatar is a 2009 Science Fiction film directed by James Cameron.
    The film takes place in a future where Earth is a polluted Crapsack World, though the story itself unfolds on Pandora,
    a large moon of the planet Polyphemus in the Alpha Centauri system. It has lots of Unobtainium (seriously, that's what
    it's called as an in-joke; most viewers miss the single line in the film in which it is revealed that the characters
    in the film intentionally chose the name ironically), which the human Resources Development Administration is mining,
    but in order to get at the richest source of it, they need to relocate a clan of the native population; ten-foot-tall,
    blue Humanoid Aliens called the Na'vi who live in the forests.

    A paraplegic former U.S. Marine named Jake Sully (Sam Worthington) is given a remotely-controlled Na'vi body called
    an "avatar" in order to communicate with the Na'vi and gain their trust, but the resident General Ripper Colonel
    Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang) has other ideas and wants to remove the Na'vi by force. Jake ends up torn between
    his humanity and the adopted Na'vi way of life, made harder by his growing romance with Neytiri, The Chief's Daughter
    (Zoe Saldana).
    James Cameron first got the idea for Avatar in The '90s and wrote an 80-page scriptment for it, but he shelved the project because he felt that the special effects technology at the time was insufficient for portraying Pandora and its inhabitants adequately, particularly in regards to translating actors' faces to CGI. Thus, he spent the time between Titanic (1997) and Avatar creating smaller products as he developed these technologies and amassed a large budget for the movie.
